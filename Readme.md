#### Summary
FstFile is console utility for working with MechCommander game archives -- FST, DPK formats.
The program supports: archive viewing, selective extraction, full archive unpacking, creation of a list of contents, and packing into archive by list-file.

#### Syntax
The program supports the commands for selecting the operating mode, modifiers for editing display mode, and parameters will for file paths involved in operations.
Commands and modifiers are written together. Use of space is not allowed and be interpreted by the program as invalid parameter. The command must be preceded by a dash character.
It is possible to open a file for viewing by adding path to the file as first parameter.

```
FstFile <command+modificator> <first parameter> <second parameter>
```

#### Operating modes
|Command            |Symbol |Mods Parameters                    |Result|
|-------------------|-------|-----------------------------------|------|
|**S**how info      |s      |p      <Source arc.>               |The program will show all contents of archive.|
|**U**npack all     |u      |api    <Source arc.>               |Unpack contents of archive into a separate folder.|
|**E**xtract single |e      |api    <Source arc.> <EntryNumber> |Single extraction of a file from archive.|
|create **L**ist    |l      |api    <Source arc.>               |Listing contents of archive in a list-file.|
|**P**ack           |p      |api    <Source list> <Target arc.> |Packing files into a new archive by list-file.|
|**C**omplex        |c      |api    <Source arc.>               |Complex unpacking of archive simultaneously with creation of list-file (Unpack all + create List).|

#### Display modifiers
|Modifier           |Symbol |Result|
|-------------------|-------|------|
|ignore **A**ll     |a      |This modifier uses the following two at the same time. (Cannot be used with 'Show info' mode).|
|ignore **P**ause   |p      |Pause at end of the program will be ignored, and after task is completed, the utility will terminate its work. This parameter is useful for batch operation of the utility.|
|ignore **I**nfo    |i      |All information output while the program is running will be skipped, only the exit message (and errors) will be shown. This modifier does not work with 'Show info' mode.|

Absence of modifiers will display all information available for the mode and the program will wait for any key to be pressed after end of work for its completion.

The case of the command and modifier characters is not important. Running the utility without parameters displays this help. Violation of the number, order of input or nature of the arguments will display corresponding error.

#### Examples
